### LLMs & GenAI for Scientific R&D - from data to insight delivery

instructor-led training; flipped learning model \


course repo: https://github.com/cachatj/LLM_GenAI_for_Sci_course_2024



---
**RE:** provide a comprehensive instructor-led-training program on generative

AI (Gen AI) for. This program will leverage a

flipped classroom approach to equip participants with the knowledge and skills necessary to utilize Gen AI for tasks such as:



* document summarization, 
* content creation, 
* code assistance, and 
* research support.


#### TARGET AUDIENCE

intended to instruct 25+ NASA researchers and engineers interested in using LLM & GenAI workflows in their projects. Students are not expected to have previous experience with LLMs, or Gen AI. However, familiarity with python, SQL & cloud data analytics platforms (GCP, AWS, Azure) is a head start. 

This course lays out a roadmap, and provides students with learning resources they can get hands-on with immediately. As a flipped learning model, all participants are expected to have done the reading & attempted the exercise _BEFORE_ coming together for an in-person session.

   <td>To ensure relevance and diversity, I recommend the students use their own datasets before publicly available options. PDFs, Documents, Data, Databases, Multimedia - whatever the learner is interested in interacting with and utilizing in the weeks exercises, notebooks, readings. This also allows students to learn about data pre-processing, standardizing and loading. 
<p>
I will encourage everyone to spend more time looking for Github Repos or Cloud Engineering notebooks or cookbooks and attempting to push their data of interest through the analysis more so that starting with public, faceless generic data. 
<p>
There are many public datasets available:
<p>

    - Common Crawl dataset for large-scale text analysis
<p>

    - Wikipedia dumps for knowledge-based tasks

    - ImageNet for computer vision projects

    - UCI Machine Learning Repository for a variety of structured datasets
<p>

    - Kaggle datasets for real-world problem-solving scenarios
<p>

    - OpenAI's GPT-3 API for generative text tasks (with appropriate usage limits)
